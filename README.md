# Youtube_Extension

This is a simple chrome extension that allows you to filter YouTube comments by sentiment. We built it for the BYU 2024 YHack hackathon and won the "Best Design" award.

## Running the extension

After cloning the repository, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
ng build
```

Then, open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`. Turn on developer mode, click "Load unpacked", and select the `dist/Youtube_Extension/browser` folder and click "Select". The extension should now be installed on your browser.
